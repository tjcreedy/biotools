# USAGE

my $usage =<<USAGE;

Description:
	This script finds and extracts sequences corresponding to CDS, rRNA and/or tRNA annotations from a set of sequences from one or more genbank-format flat files. Specify which regions to extract using the -regiontypes argument (default is -regiontypes CDS rRNA)
	
	The region name is identified based on the /gene, /label or /product tag in the genbank-format flat file. Two methods are used to ensure that naming variants are correctly identified as the same gene:
		1. the gene name is converted to uppercase (so that "atp8" is the same as "ATP8")
		2. the script removes any semicolons, underscores, hyphens or spaces, and any characters following these, from gene names ("ATP8-0" -> "ATP8", "ATP8; atp8" -> "ATP8", etc) - except if the first part of the name is "MT-".
	
	Additionally, common naming variants of mitochondrial regions are hardcoded into the script (e.g. CDS regions COX1 and COI will both be output to COX1). The variants that the script knows about can be reviewed using the -showgenes option.
	
	A separate fasta will be written for each region found, containing all of the sequences of that CDS from across all the different sequences in the genbank file(s). The LOCUS name of the sequence in the genbank-format flat file will be used as the sequence header. Alternatively, you can try to use use the organism field of the genbank file as the sequence header using --organism: note that this is very likely to give blank or non-unique headers, and if the script fails to parse the species name it will revert to the LOCUS field.
	
	Optionally, you can specify that sequences will only be output for entries where a minimum number of regions are met using -minregion. Similarly, you can optionally specify that certain regions must be present in a sequence for it to output any regions using the -reqregion option. For example, if you only wanted to retrieve sequences for regions from genomes that contain COX1 and COB, you would specify -reqregion COX1 COB. The names used must conform with the standard set of output names (the second column when using the -showgenes option). All available regions will still be output.
	
	Also optionally, you can output a list of genes present for each sequence by supplying the path to the output text file name to --presence.
	
	In rare cases, an annotation is truncated by the end of a contig at the 5' end, which may leave an incomplete codon at the start of an output sequence and cause downstream issues. To detect this, the script can optionally remove these excess 1 or 2 bases using the -keepframe option. Note this only works if the /codon_start tag is present in the genbank-format features. 

Usage:

	perl $script -genbank <in.gb> [<in2.gb>] -out <out/> [-minregion <n>] [-reqregion <CDS1> <CDS2>] [-regiontypes CDS tRNA rRNA] [-keepframe] [-presence genepresence.txt]
	perl $script -showgenes

Arguments:

	       genbank:  The path to one or more genbank files from which CDS regions should be extracted
	           out:  The path to a directory in which to place a fasta file for each CDS
	     minregion:  A minimum number of regions that must be present in a sequence for it to output anything
	     reqregion:  A list of regions that must be present in a sequence for it to output anything
	        filter:  A list of LOCUS names, one per line, to use from the genbank file
	   regiontypes:  One or more region types to extract, currently CDS rRNA and/or tRNA
	     showgenes:  Prints the hardcoded conversions for region naming variants
	      organism:  Prints the organism name, if retreivable, instead of the LOCUS
	 writeunknowns:  Writes out fastas for unidentifiable annotations anyway
	     keepframe:  Removes excess out-of-frame bases at the beginning of truncated annotations
	      presence:  The path to a text file to which gene presences by input sequence will be written
	          help:  Prints out this helpful message
